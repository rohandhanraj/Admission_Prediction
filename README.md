# Admission_Prediction
Graduate Admission Prediction Model
**A graduate application is to be completed by a student who wants to enroll in a Master's or doctoral degree. A graduate application will be reviewed by the department that the student applies to along with a Graduate Program Director and/or an admissions committee.**  
**So in this dataset we will predict the Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective.**
